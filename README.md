## Spark Cluster Zookeeper

This is an extension of [shuaicj/spark-cluster](https://github.com/shuaicj/spark-cluster),
and is also a complete [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org) cluster based on docker-compose,
but with multiple `Spark Master` for HA via [Apache Zookeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org).
